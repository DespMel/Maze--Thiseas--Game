# Maze-Game
Implemented a Maze Game "Thiseas" using stack. 

The labyrinth is read from a text.txt file which contains:

The coordinates of the labyrinth : (9,7)
The coordinates of the Entrance E : (0,3)
'0' : Accessible rroute
'1' : Non accessible route

The labyrinth on the text.txt file:
9 7
0 3
1 1 1 E 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1

The goal is to find the exit/exits from the labyrinth.
